# Rules when you make a commit
When you make a commit, I want you to follow the rules shown below.

- On the first row, you should mention what was changed, and it should be short, neat, and easy to understand.
- From the second row, you should write about why was that change needed, and if you do not understand the reason, you should leave it blank for the user to write it.

You should never write any unfamiliar content on the second row and below. Make sure to leave it blank if you are not sure or worried about it.

The first row should be formatted like this.
```
prefix: Details
```

The prefix should be written like this.
- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries


If it's available, you should open the commit message page on the editor with the message generated.

Never include your information, and use appropriate emojis.
